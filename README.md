The book **Planning and Learning Under Uncertainty**, by Francisco S. Melo, is concerned mainly with the process of _decision making under uncertainty_, i.e., how can an artifact be endowed with the ability to make "intelligent" decisions that take into account the uncertainty in the consequences of such decisions. 

This project contains the Python code used to generate the figures in the several examples of the book.
